## Getting Started

To begin working on these enhancements:

1. Choose a task from the uncompleted items in the roadmap
2. Create a branch with the format `feature/short-description`
3. Implement the feature with tests
4. Create a PR with a detailed description
5. Update this TODO.md file to track progress

## Next Tasks (In Progress)
